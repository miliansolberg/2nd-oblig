    <p>''Russian hackers have most likely sabotaged a jet that was driven by an American soldier'' Says a high ranking commander in the US Military.

    This might spell doom for all flying vehicles, especially in war. The US military department says there is likely no chance of solving this issue in the case of a new world war, which might come sooner than enticipated.
