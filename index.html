    <p>''Russian hackers have most likely sabotaged a jet that was driven by an American soldier'' Says a high ranking commander in the US Military.
    Wether or not this was done by the Russian governmet is up for debate, but this might be a new in the making way to attack the enemies from the inside.
    This might spell doom for all flying vehicles, especially in war. The US military department says there is likely no chance of solving this issue in the case of a new world war, which might come sooner than enticipated.
    There is a rumor a there was a drunk bet to fly the jet, which ended in a tragic end. The rumor states the US military is covering it up.</p>
